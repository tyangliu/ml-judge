# Background

An individual's annual income is influenced by a variety of factors, such as
age, gender, education level, etc. You are given census data for around 45
thousand individuals in the United States (collected by the US Census Bureau),
and your challenge is to predict whether a given individual earns above or below
USD 50k a year. Each individual is described by 15 features, both discrete and
continuous. The label, 'income', represents the income level and is binary
('<=50K' or '>50k').

# Scoring

Your score for this challenge will be the percentage of correct predictions on
the test set, rounded to nearest 10th of a percent (same scores post-rounding
will be tied).
