# Background

A common usage of language models, needed by almost any social media platform, is detection of spammy comments. While most comments on popular sites are genuine, organic comments, a huge proportion are advertisements, malicious spam, or other annoyances such as begging for subscriptions on YouTube. This week, we challenge you to detect spammy YouTube comments.

You are given a dataset of sentences, and a starter file that loads the data. Each sentence has a corresponding label of 1 or 0, corresponding to toxic or not.
