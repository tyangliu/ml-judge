# Background

One of the hardest problems that people struggle with on a daily basis, is coming up with descriptive yet amusing captions for the images they post on social media. Struggle no more, for now deep learning models will save us a virtually uncountable number of hours by automagically captioning our images for us, leaving us with more time to spend developing deep learning models.

# Input Data
Your input data will be a collection of images. Given an input image, you are to generate an acceptable caption for it, using whatever model you desire.

The input images are the ones in the `train_ids` variable in the starter notebook for Assignment 4.

# Scoring
Your score for this challenge will be the BLEU score, similar to the `compute_bleu` function in your assignment.
