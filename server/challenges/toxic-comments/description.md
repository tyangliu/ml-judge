# Background

Toxicity on the internet is a major problem. In this warm-up challenge, we have provided you with a dataset of sentences, which have binary
labels indicating toxic/not-toxic. Your job is to do the necessary preprocessing and train a model that correctly classifiers whether
a sentence exhibits toxicity.

# Input Data

You are given a dataset of sentences, and a starter file that loads the data. Each sentence has a corresponding label of 1 or 0, corresponding to toxic or not.

# Scoring

Your score will be the prediction accuracy on a test dataset to two decimal points of precision.
