The MNIST database contains\n60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.\n\nMNIST is often used a \"hello world\" dataset to benchmark novel image \nclassification algorithms. So feel free to get creative and try something\nnew!\n\n# Input Data\n\nEach input sample is a 28x28 matrix depicting a handwritten digit. In \nstarter.py, you\\'ll find code that loads in the data for you (therefore\nallowing you to focus on the interesting stuff). \n\n# Scoring\n\nYour score for this challenge will be the test error rate, the percentage of\ntest samples that you get wrong. \n\nYou should be able to get < 10% error rate easily. You should aim for a score\nof < 1% error rate, or if you\\'re feeling exceptionally ambitious, a score of \n< 0.5%."},"1":{"difficulty":"Easy","date":"2017-11-24T00:00:00-08:00","due_date":"2017-12-08T00:00:00-08:00","id":"titanic","type":"Classification (Binary)","resources":"Lorem Ipsum 2","path":"titanic","title":"Titanic Survivors","score_order":"default","submission":"Your submission should be a zip file containing:\n* src\/ - directory containing your source code files\n* predictions.csv - your predictions for the test set.\n* readme.txt - text file with a brief summary of your approach and model.","description":"# Background\n\nThe sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the deadliest maritime tragedies.\nDuring her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg,\nkilling 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. Amongst others, one of the main\nreasons for the large number of casualties was the lack of lifeboats. Although\nthere was some luck involved, policies like ``women and children first '' meant\nthat some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.\n\n\nIn this challenge, your goal is to predict which passengers survived the\ntragedy.\n\n# Input Data\n\nThe input data is a csv file with passenger information as follows:\n\n| Variable | Definition                        | Notes                                    |  \n| -------- | ----------------------------      | ------                                   |  \n| survival | whether a passenger survived      | 0 = no, 1 = yes; not present in test set |  \n| pclass   | ticket class                      | could be 1, 2, 3                         |  \n| sex      | sex                               |                                          |  \n| Age      | age in years                      |                                          |  \n| sibsp    | # of siblings \/ spouses on board  |                                          |  \n| parch    | # of parents \/ children on board  |                                          |  \n| ticket   | ticket number                     |                                          |  \n| fare     | ticket fare                       |                                          |  \n| cabin    | cabin number                      |                                          |  \n| embarked | port of embarkation               | C=Cherbourg, Q=Queenstown, S=Southampton |  \n\n# Scoring\n\nYour score for this challenge will be the percentage of correct predictions on\nthe test set, rounded to nearest 10th of a percent (same scores post-rounding\nwill be tied)."}},"users":{},"challenges_list":{"2":{"id":"mnist","date":"2017-11-24T00:00:00-08:00","title":"Handwritten Digit Recognition","due_date":"2017-12-08T00:00:00-08:00"},"1":{"id":"titanic","date":"2017-11-24T00:00:00-08:00","title":"Titanic Survivors","due_date":"2017-12-08T00:00:00-08:00"}},"challenge_submissions_9ed47aecd43a787ef53a9b103262a5519fd47106":{},"user_tokens":{},"_default":{}}
